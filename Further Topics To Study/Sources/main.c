/*
    Defining your own tpes (typedef)
    Similar to when defining an enum.

    More on preprocessors
    String concatenation. Used for optimization.

    Void *
    Used for flexibility.

    Static libraries and shared objects
    Creating your own libraries and objects.

    Macros
    Run by the preprocessors.

    Unions
    Having a multiple type of data returned. A member being an int and a float.

    Function pointers
    Pointers that points to functions.
    
    Advanced pointers
    Double pointers, etc.

    Variable arguments to functions (variadic functions)
    Creating your own.

    Dynamic linking (dlm_open)
    Opening up libraries at runtime. Better performance.

    Signals, forking and inter-process communication
    Programs communicating via files, sockets, etc.

    Threading and concurrency
    Multiple execution points in the program.
    
    Sockets
    Used for networking. Getting data from another computer.

    setjmp and lonjmp
    Restoring state.

    More on memory management and fragmentation
    Manage memory more wisely avoiding fragmentations.

    More on making a program portable
    Allows the program to be run in various OSs.

    Interfacing wwith kernel modules (drivers and ioctls)
    Interactions with this part of the OS.

    More on compiler and linker flags
    Make the program more efficient. "-Wall" was an example.

    Advanced use of fdb
    Using the debugger in a more advanced way.

    Profiling and tracing tools (gprof, dtrace, strace)
    Tools that analyse your code to see if there are any bad programming practises,
    dead code, deadlocks, etc.

    Memory debugging tools such as valgrind
    Used when you have problems in memory.
