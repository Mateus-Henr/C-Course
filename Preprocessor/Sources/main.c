// Preprocessor
// It's a unique feature of C language.
// It is a good pratise to use them for better development, readability and portability.
// This is a part of C compilation process that recognizes special statements that are analysed before the program itself executes.
// They are "instructions" to do something before compiling the source code. 
// They don't have a specific position to be at but they are usually placed at the top of the source code.
// They have a "#" at the beginning, and the "#" + "command" are called preprocessor directive, "#include" is an example of it.

// The "#define" preprocessor
// It's used for creating constants and macros, by using it you can optimize your code.

// The "#include" preprocessor
// It's used for building your own libraries or for importing external libraries.

// The conditional statements preprocessor
// They are "#ifdef", "#endif", "#else" and "ifdef".
