// The "printf" function
// This is a standard library function.
// It outputs information to the command line (the standard output stream, which is the command line by default).
// This information could be text or even program results, so it's very commonly used. And since it can be used for displaying
// variables values and etc, this is used for debugging as well.
// The displayed information is based on the content within parenthesis.
// Finishes with a semicolon since it's a statement, example below.


int main()
{
    printf("Hi, my name is Mateus.");

    return 0;
